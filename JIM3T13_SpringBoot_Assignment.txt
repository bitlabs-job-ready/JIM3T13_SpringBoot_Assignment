Assignment: Building a SpringBoot CRUD Application with a Real-Time Chat Feature 

 
1: Setting up the SpringBoot project and connecting to a database 

Create a new SpringBoot project and set up the dependencies for connecting to a database (e.g. Hibernate) 

Create a model class for storing user information (e.g. name, email, password, age, gender, mobile number) and a repository interface for performing CRUD operations on the user table 

Set up a connection to a database and test the CRUD operations using the repository interface 

2: Implementing the registration API 

Create a controller class and a corresponding API endpoint for handling user registration 

Validate the incoming request data to ensure that all required fields are filled out and that the email is unique 

Return a response indicating the success or failure of the registration process 

3: Implementing the login API 

Create a controller class and a corresponding API endpoint for handling user login 

Implement the login functionality using the user repository and password hashing 

Validate the incoming request data to ensure that the email and password are correct 

Return a response indicating the success or failure of the login process, along with a unique token for the user if they were successfully logged in 

4: Implementing the select API 

Create a controller class and a corresponding API endpoint for handling user selection 

Implement the selection functionality using the user repository and a controller class 

Allow users to search for other users by name, email, or other criteria 

Return a response with a list of matching users 

5: Implementing the update API 

Create a controller class and a corresponding API endpoint for handling user updates 

Implement the update functionality using the user repository and a controller class 

Validate the incoming request data to ensure that all required fields are filled out and that the email is unique 

Return a response indicating the success or failure of the update process 

6: Implementing the delete API 

Create a controller class and a corresponding API endpoint for handling user deletion 

Implement the delete functionality using the user repository and a controller class 

Validate the incoming request data to ensure that the user has permission to delete the specified user 

Return a response indicating the success or failure of the delete process
